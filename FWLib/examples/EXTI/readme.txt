Example description
===================
This example shows how to configure an external interrupt line.
In this example, an EXTI line is configured to generate an interrupt on each
falling edge. In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is
toggled.
This led will be toggled due to the softawre interrupt generated on the EXTI Line 
then at each falling edge.


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h  Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h   Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h     Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c     Interrupt handlers
main.c             Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1 led connected to PC.06 pin
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9).
     
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1 led connected to PF.06 pin
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG.08 (EXTI Line8).
      

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_exti.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
