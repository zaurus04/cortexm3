Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how  to use the USART in Smartcard mode. 
The example gives only the possibility to read the ATR and decode it into 
predefined buffer.
First, the code is waiting for an card insertion. If a card is detected through
the EXTI Line interrupt (connected to the Smartcard detect pin), a reset signal
is applied to the card through its reset pin.
As response to this reset, the card transmit the ATR which will be stored in 
predefined buffer. Once the ATR is received, it is decoded and stored in a specific
structure (SC_A2R) and the card protocol type is stored in a variable.
ATRDecodeStatus variable must be equal to 1 (PASSED) when the sequence succeed.

The used Smartcard should be ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible.

USART3 configured as follow:
  - Word Length = 9 Bits
  - 0.5 Stop Bit
  - Even parity
  - BaudRate = 12096 baud
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Tx and Rx enabled
  - USART Clock enabled
  - USART CPOL: Clock is active low
  - USART CPHA: Data is captured on the second edge 
  - USART LastBit: The clock pulse of the last data bit is not output to 
                   the SCLK pin


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Plug a Smartcard (ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible) into the dedicated Smartcard 
      connector CN16.
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Plug a Smartcard (ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible) into  the dedicated Smartcard 
      connector CN18.
    - Make sure that Jumper 15 (JP15) and Jumper 16 (JP16) are fitted.

  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  + stm32f10x_exti.c
        
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
