Example description
===================
This example provides a basic communication between USART1 and USART2 using 
interrupts.
USART2 sends TxBuffer2 to USART1 which sends TxBuffer1 to USART2. The data received 
by USART1 and USART2 are stored respectively in RxBuffer1 and RxBuffer2. The data
transfer is managed in USART1_IRQHandler and USART2_IRQHandler in stm32f10x_it.c file.

USART1 and USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
       
        
Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
main.c               Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN5 and CN6.
    - Note: in this case USART2 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software on 
            PD.05 and PD.06 respectively. 
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN12 and CN8.
  
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
