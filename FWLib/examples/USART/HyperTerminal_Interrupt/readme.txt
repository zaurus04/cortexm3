Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to use the USART1 Transmit and Receive 
interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.

First, the USART1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.
The string that you have entered is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive
buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as maximum (the reception is stopped when this
maximum receive value is reached).

The USART1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

Note: When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

  
Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers source file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
There is no need for any modification when switching between these two boards.

 - The USART1 signals (Rx and Tx) must be connected to a DB9 connector using
   a RS232 transceiver.

 - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
   (CN6 on STM3210B-EVAL board and CN12 on STM3210E-EVAL board) and PC serial port.  

 - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 

      
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
