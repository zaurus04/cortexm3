Example description
===================
This example provides a basic communication between USART1 and USART2 in 
Half-Duplex mode using flags.

First, the USART1 sends data from TxBuffer1 buffer to USART2 using TXE flag.
Data received using RXNE flag by USART2 is stored in RxBuffer2 then compared with
the sent ones and the result of this comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus1" 
variable.
 
Then, the USART2 sends data from TxBuffer2 buffer to USART1 using TXE flag.
Data received using RXNE flag by USART1 is stored in RxBuffer1 then compared with
the sent ones and the result of this comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus2" 
variable.     

USART1 and USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 230400 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - Even parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
main.c               Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Connect USART1_Tx(PA.09) to USART2_Tx(PD.05) and connect a pull-up resistor to 
      this line (10K). 
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Connect USART1_Tx(PA.09) to USART2_Tx(PA.02) and connect a pull-up resistor to 
      this line (10K). 
 
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
      
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
