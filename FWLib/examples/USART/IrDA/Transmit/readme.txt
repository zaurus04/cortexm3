Example description
===================
This example provides a basic communication USART3 IrDA transmit mode. Five pins,
configured in input floating mode, are used to select the byte to be send at 
each pin state change. 

These bytes are:
  - 0x00 if no key pressed
  - 0x01 if SEL pin state change
  - 0x02 if RIGHT pin state change 
  - 0x03 if LEFT pin state change 
  - 0x04 if UP pin state change 
  - 0x05 if DOWN pin state change 
  
USART3 configured as follow:
   - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
   - Word Length = 8 Bits
   - One Stop Bit
   - No parity
   - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
   - Receive and transmit enabled

The USART IrDA example provides two IrDA program: transmitter&receiver and requires two boards
to be able to run the full demonstration:
 - one board will act as IrDA transmitter
 - one board will act as IrDA receiver

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use DOWN push-button connected to pin PD.14
    - Use UP push-button connected to pin PD.08
    - Use SEL push-button connected to pin PD.12
    - Use RIGHT push-button connected to pin PE.00
    - Use RIGHT push-button connected to pin PE.01                   
    - Use an IrDA tranceiver connected to the USART3 Tx pin (U11 connector, JP5 
      jumper must be fitted).
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use DOWN push-button connected to pin PD.03
    - Use UP push-button connected to pin PG.15
    - Use SEL push-button connected to pin PG.07
    - Use RIGHT push-button connected to pin PG.13
    - Use RIGHT push-button connected to pin PG.14   
    - Use an IrDA tranceiver connected to the USART3 Tx pin (U13 connector, JP21
      and JP22 jumper must be fitted).
  
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
      
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
