Example description
===================
This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USARTx.
USARTx can be USART1, USART2, USART3, UART4 or UART5; to select the USART 
interface to be used uncomment the '#define USE_USARTx' line in 'platform_config.h'
file.

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
main.c               Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + The USARTx signals (Rx, Tx) must be connected to a DB9 connector using a RS232
   transceiver. 
 
 + Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
   and PC serial port. 

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      (CN6 for USART1, CN5 for USART2 in the STM3210B-EVAL board) 
      and PC serial port.
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      (CN12 for USART1, CN8 for USART2 in the STM3210E-EVAL board) 
      and PC serial port.
 

 - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
