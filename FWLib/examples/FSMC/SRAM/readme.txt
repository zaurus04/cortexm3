Example description
===================
This example provides a basic example of how to use the FSMC firmware library and
an associate driver to perform read/write operations on the IS61WV51216BLL SRAM
memory mounted on STM3210E-EVAL board.


Directory contents

stm32f10x_it.c      Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h      Header for stm32f10x_it.c
fsmc_sram.c         Driver for SRAM memory
fsmc_sram.h         Header for fsmc_sram.c       
main.c              Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL evaluation board.

    
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  + stm32f10x_fsmc.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
