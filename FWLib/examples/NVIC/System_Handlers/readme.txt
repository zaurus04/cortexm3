Example description
===================
This example demontrates the use of the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) 
and system handlers: 

- Assignment of a descendant system handlers preemption priority for each system
handler:
   - NMI has -1 as preemption priority
   - PSV has 0 preemption priority
   - SVCall has 1 preemption priority
   - SysTick has 2 preemption priority

- Configuration of SysTick timer to generate an interrupt on each end of count

- In the Systick handler routine: a LED1  toggle each 1s and the SVC instruction
is executed. This will activate the SVCall handler to preempt the current instruction 
stream. In the SVCall handler routine, a led connected to LED2 pin is toggling and the
pending bit of the PSV handler is set by software.
The PSV which has a higher preemption priority will preempt the SVCall handler and 
will toggle a LED3. Also, in this handler routine, the NMI pending bit is set and 
the NMI handler is activated and the LED4 is toggling.


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins

    
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_systick.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
