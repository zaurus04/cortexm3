Example description
===================
This example describes how to use the NVIC firmware library to demonstrate the 
Cortex-M3 low power modes capabilities (WFE and WFI). 

This example uses three EXTI lines(Wakeup button EXTI Line, Key button EXTI Line
& Tamper button EXTI Line)to generate interrupts and event on each falling edge.
The Wakeup button EXTI Line and Tamper button EXTI Line are configured in 
interrupt mode and the Key button EXTI Line in event mode. The user has to select
which low power mode would execute through a five define in the main code.

These choices are:

   - Wait For Interrupt (WFI) Sleep On Exit: in this mode the WFI instruction is
    excecuted automatically on an exception Return. The exception will be executed
    if has enough priority to run and the core will return in the WFI mode. 
    To run this behaviour proceed as following:
      
      * Choose the #WFISLEEPONEXIT define and comment others defines
      * run the example
      * The Wakeup button EXTI Line toggles LD4.
      * Push the Tamper button, the SLEEPONEXIT function is selected
      Any edge on the Wakeup button EXTI Line or Tamper button EXTI Line will 
      execute the EXTI interrupt, when exit from the ISR the core will enter WFI
      mode. Any time you push the Wakeup button the core exit from WFI mode, 
      LD4 is toggled then the  core enters again in WFI mode.
      This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.

    - Wait For Interrupt (WFI) Sleep Now: in this mode the WFI instruction is 
      excecuted directly. To run this behaviour proceed as following:

      * Choose the #WFISLEEPNOW define and comment others defines
      * run the example
      * The Tamper button EXTI Line will toggle LD1 and put the core in the WFI mode.  
      * To wakeup the Core use the Wakeup button that will toggle the LD3.
      This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.
  
   - Wait For Event (WFE) SEV ON PEND: in this mode the WFE instruction is excecuted
     directly and the main instruction stream (execution priority) is boosted by the
     register PRIMASK (main priority = 0).
     To run this behaviour proceed as following:

     * Choose the #WFESEVONPEND define and comment others defines
     * run the example
     * The Tamper button EXTI Line will boost the execution priority to 0 (no 
       interrupt will be  executed after due to the priority boosting), toggle 
       LD1 and put the core in WFE mode. 
     * To wakeUp the Core use the Wakeup button that will not toggle the LD3 but
       will only wakeup the core from the WFE (SEV ON PEND). 
       This EXTI Line interrupt has passed from unpended state to a pended state 
       which wakeup the core from the WFE.
     * To wakeup the core also you can use theTamper button configured in event
       mode.
     * if the #RTC_Alarm_WFEWakeUp define is enabled, the RTC alarm will wakeUp 
       the Core after 6 seconds (if none of Tamper button EXTI Line and Key 
       button EXTI Line was used before this delay to wakeUp the Core)
  
   - Wait For Event (WFE) SEV ON EVENT: in this mode the WFE instruction is 
     excecuted directly. To run this behaviour proceed as following:

    * Choose the #WFESEVONEVENT define and comment others defines
    * run the example
    * The Tamper button EXTI Line will toggle LD1 and put the core in the WFE mode. 
    * To wakeup the Core use the Wakeup button that will toggle the LD3.
    * To wakeup the core also you can use the Key button configured in event mode.
    * if the #RTC_Alarm_WFEWakeUp define is enabled, the RTC alarm will wakeUp 
      the Core after 6 seconds (if none of Tamper button EXTI Line and Key button
      EXTI Line was used before this delay to wakeup the Core)
      This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.

LD4 is toggled to indicate whether the MCU is in RUN or in low power mode.
