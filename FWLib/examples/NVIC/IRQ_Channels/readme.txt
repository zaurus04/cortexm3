Example description
===================
This example demontrates the use of the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC)
IRQ Channels configuration: 

- Configuration of 3 TIM (TIM2..TIM4)timers to generate an interrupt on each 
  counter update event.
- The three timers are linked to their correspondant Update IRQ channel.
- Assignment of a ascendant IRQ priority for each IRQ channel :
  TIM2 has a preemption priority of 0 and TIM4 has a preemption priority of 2.
- In each interrupt routine: 
   - TIM2 toggles a LED1 each 1s 
   - TIM3 toggles a LED2 each 2s 
   - TIM4 toggles a LED3 each 3s 


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1, LD2 and LD3 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07 and PC.08
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1, LD2 and LD3 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7 and PF.08

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_tim.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
