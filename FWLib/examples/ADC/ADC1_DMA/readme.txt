Example description
===================
This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to converts continuously ADC channel14.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the ADC_ConvertedValue variable.
The ADC1 clock is set to 14 MHz.


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.

 - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
   (potentiometer RV1 on STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL boards) 
   
      
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_adc.c
  + stm32f10x_dma.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
