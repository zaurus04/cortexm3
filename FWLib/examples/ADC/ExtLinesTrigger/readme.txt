Example description
===================
This example describes how to trigger ADC regular and injected groups channels 
conversion using two external line events. Discontinuous mode is enabled for regular
group channel conversion and configured to convert one regular channel on each 
external trigger.

ADC1 is configured to start regular group channel conversion on EXTI11 event.
On detection of the first rising edge on PE.11 pin, the conversion of the first regular
channel (ADC channel4) is done and its converted value is transfered by DMA to 
ADC_RegularConvertedValueTab table. On the following edge detection, the second 
regular channel (ADC channel14) is automatically converted and its converted value
is stored by DMA in the same table. The number of transmitted data by DMA, in this 
example is limited to 64 data.

The procedure is repeated for both regular channels on each EXTI11 event.
ADC1 is configured to start injected group channel conversion on EXTI15 event.
On detection of the first rising edge on PE.15 pin all selected injected channels, which
are two in this example (ADC channel11 and channel12), are converted and an interrupt 
is generated on JEOC flag rising at the end of all injected channels conversion. 
Both injected channels converted results are stored in ADC_InjectedConvertedValueTab 
table inside the interrupt routine.
The procedure is repeated for injected channels on each EXTI15 event.
The ADC1 clock is set to 14 MHz.


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.

 - Connect a known voltage, between 0-3.3V, to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
   (potentiometer RV1 on STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL boards), ADC Channel4 mapped 
   on pin PA.04, ADC Channel11 mapped on pin PC.01 and ADC Channel12 mapped on pin PC.02.
 - Connect a push-button to pin PE.11 (EXTI Line11) and another push-button to 
   pin PE.15 (EXTI Line15).      

   
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_adc.c
  + stm32f10x_dma.c
  + stm32f10x_exti.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
