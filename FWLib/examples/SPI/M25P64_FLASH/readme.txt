Example description
===================
This example provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library
and an associate SPI FLASH driver to communicate with an M25P64 FLASH.

The first step consist in reading the SPI Flash ID. A comparison between the ID 
read from SPI flash and the expected one is done and a specific GPIO pin is set 
in case of success otherwise this GPIO pin is reset.  

Using this driver the program performs an erase of the sector to be accessed, a 
write of a Tx_Buffer, defined in the main.c file, to the memory followed by a read
of the written data. Then data read from the memory stored in the Rx_Buffer are
compared with the expected values of the Tx_Buffer. The result of this comparison
is stored in the "TransferStatus1" variable.

A second erase of the same sector is done at the end, and a test is done to be
sure that all the data written there are erased further to the sector erase. All
the data location are read and checked with 0xFF value. The result of this test
is stored in "TransferStatus2" variable which is FAILED in case of error.

The SPI1 is configured as Master with an 8bits data size. A GPIO pin is used
as output push-pull to drive the SPI Flash chip select pin.  
The FLASH_WriteAddress and the FLASH_ReadAddress where the program start the write 
and the read operations are defined in the main.c file. 
The system clock is set to 72MHz and SPI1 baudrate to 18 Mbit/s.

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h and spi_flash.h files.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PC.06 and PC.07 pins
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PF.06 and PF.07 pins

On the STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation boards, this 
SPI Flash is already available and there is no need to any extra hardware connections. 

If a different platform is used:
 - Connect both SPI1 and SPI FLASH pins as following:
    - Connect SPI1_NSS (PA.04) pin to SPI Flash chip select (pin1) and use the 
        STM3210B-EVAL hardware configuration defines.
    - Connect SPI1_SCLK (PA.05) pin to SPI Flash serial clock (pin6).
    - Connect SPI1_MISO (PA.06) pin to SPI Flash serial data output (pin2).
    - Connect SPI1_MOSI (PA.07) pin to SPI Flash serial data input (pin5).
    - Connect SPI Flash Write Protect (pin3) to Vdd
    - Connect SPI Flash Hold (pin7) to Vdd
    - Connect SPI Flash Vcc (pin8) to Vdd
    - Connect SPI Flash Vss (pin4) to Vss

Note: in STM3210E-EVAL board, the jumper 14 (USB Disconnect) must be set in 
      position 1<->2 in order to not interfer with SPI2 MISO pin PB14.

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_spi.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
