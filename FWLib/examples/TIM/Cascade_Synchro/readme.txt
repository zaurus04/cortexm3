Example description
===================

This example shows how to synchronize TIM peripherals in cascade mode.
In this example three timers are used:

Timers synchronisation in cascade mode:
1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output  

2/TIM3 is slave for TIM2 and Master for TIM4,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger 
 - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
	  are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 update event).
 - The TIM3 Update event is used as Trigger Output. 

3/TIM4 is slave for TIM3,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR2(TIM3) is used as input trigger
 - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter  are controlled by the
   Master trigger output signal(TIM3 update event).

The TIMxCLK is fixed to 72 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 72 MHz.
The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency :
TIM2 frequency = (TIM2 counter clock)/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 281.250 KHz 
and the duty cycle = TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

The TIM3 is running:
 - At (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 70.312 KHz and a duty cycle equal 
to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 25%

The TIM4 is running:
 - At (TIM3 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 17.578 Hz and a duty cycle equal 
to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 25%
  

Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program
 

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
There is no need for any modification when switching between these two boards.

Connect the 
- TIM2 CH1 (PA.00) 
- TIM3 CH1 (PA.06)
- TIM4 CH1 (PB.06) 
pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms
   
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_tim.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c

- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
