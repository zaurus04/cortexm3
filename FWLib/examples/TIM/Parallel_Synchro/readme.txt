Example description
===================

This example shows how to synchronize TIM peripherals in parallel mode.
In this example three timers are used:

Timers synchronisation in parallel mode:

1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output 
 
2/TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM2,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger for both slaves 
 - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters are controlled 
   by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

The TIMxCLK is fixed to 72 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 72 MHz.
The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency:
TIM2 frequency = TIM2 counter clock/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 281.250 KHz 
and the duty cycle is equal to TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

The TIM3 is running:
 - At (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 28.1250 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 
TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 30%

The TIM4 is running:
 - At (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 56.250 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 
TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 60%


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program
 

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
There is no need for any modification when switching between these two boards.

Connect the
- TIM2 CH1 (PA.00)
- TIM3 CH1 (PA.06) 
- TIM4 CH1 (PB.06) 
pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms.
   
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_tim.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c

- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
