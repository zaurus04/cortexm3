Example description
===================
This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three 
complementary TIM1 signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the break 
feature and to lock the desired parameters.

TIM1CLK is fixed to 72 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM1 counter
clock used is 72 MHz.

TIM1 frequency is defined as follow:
TIM1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 1.098 KHz.

The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 

TIM1 Channel1 duty cycle = TIM1_CCR1 / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 50% 
TIM1 Channel1N duty cycle = (TIM1_Period - TIM1_CCR1) / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 50%

TIM1 Channel2 duty cycle = TIM1_CCR2 / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 25%
TIM1 Channel2N duty cycle = (TIM1_Period - TIM1_CCR1) / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 75% 

TIM1 Channel3 duty cycle = TIM1_CCR3 / TIM1_Period = 12.5% 
TIM1 Channel3N duty cycle = (TIM1_Period - TIM1_CCR3) / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 87.5%

A dead time of 1.62 us is inserted between the different complementary signals, 
and the Lock level 1 is selected.
The break Polarity is used at High level.

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope. 


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
There is no need for any modification when switching between these two boards.

- Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
  - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
  - TIM1_CH1N pin (PB.13)  
  - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)  
  - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.14)  
  - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
  - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.15)

- Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a break
  event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.
  
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_tim.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c

- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
