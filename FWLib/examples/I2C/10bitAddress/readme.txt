Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to transfer a data buffer from I2C1 to
I2C2 in 10-bit addressing mode.

After enabling the two I2C peripherals, the transfer in 10-bit addressing mode
starts after the I2C1 start condition is generated. Each time an event occurs on
the master or the slave, it is managed on I2C1 or I2C2, respectively.
In this application, Tx_Buffer is transmitted from the master I2C1 to the slave
I2C2 and stored into Rx_Buffer. The transmitted and received buffers are compared
to check that all data have been correctly transferred.

The communication clock speed is set to 300KHz.


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.

 - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
 - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
 - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
 - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin

Note: The pull-up resitors are already implemented on the STM3210B-EVAL and
      STM3210E-EVAL evaluation boards. 


How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_i2c.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
