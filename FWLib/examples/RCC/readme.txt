Example description
===================
This example shows how to configure the System clock(SYSCLK) to have different
frequencies: 20MHz, 36MHz, 48MHz and 72MHz. The SYSCLK frequency is selected by
user in main.h file
It shows how to use, for debug purpose, the RCC_GetClocksFreq function to retrieve
the current status and frequencies of different on chip clocks. You can see the
RCC_ClockFreq structure content, which hold the frequencies of different on chip
clocks, using your toolchain debugger.

This example handles also the High Speed External clock (HSE) failure detection:
when the HSE clock disappears (broken or disconnected external Quartz); HSE, PLL
are disabled (but no change on PLL config), HSI selected as system clock source
and an interrupt (NMI) is generated. In the NMI ISR, the HSE, HSE ready interrupt
are enabled and once HSE clock recover, the HSERDY interrupt is generated and in
the RCC ISR routine the system clock is reconfigured to its previous state (before
HSE clock failure). You can monitor the HSE clock on the MCO pin (PA.08).

Four LEDs connected to the GPIO_LED Pin 6, Pin 7, Pin 8 and Pin 9 are toggled
with a timing defined by the Delay function.

Note: To adjust the External High Speed oscillator (HSE) Startup Timeout value,
use HSEStartUp_TimeOut variable defined in the stm32f10x_conf.h file.

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins
      
   
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
