Example description
===================
This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG IOs as standard 
GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence. 

First, the SWJ-DP is disabled. The SWJ-DP pins are configured as output push-pull.
Five LEDs connected to the PA.13(JTMS/SWDAT), PA.14(JTCK/SWCLK), PA.15(JTDI), 
PB.03(JTDO) and PB.04(JTRST) pins are toggled in an infinite loop.

Note that once the JTAG IOs are disabled, the connection with the host debugger is
lost and cannot be re-established as long as the JTAG IOs remain disabled. 

To avoid this situation, a specified pin is connected to a push-button that is used
to disable or not the JTAG IOs:
 1. push-button pressed at reset: JTAG IOs disabled
 2. push-button not pressed at reset: JTAG IOs unchanged

Before starting this example, you should disconnect your tool chain debugging probe
and run the example in standalone mode.

Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h       Header for stm32f10x_it.c

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Connect five leds to pins PA.13, PA.14, PA.15, PB.03 and PB.04. 
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9).
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Connect five leds to pins PA.13, PA.14, PA.15, PB.03 and PB.04. 
    - Use the Key push-button connectedto pin PG.08 (EXTI Line8).

      
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
